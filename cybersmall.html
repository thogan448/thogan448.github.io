            <p>Smaller companies are feeding grounds for hackers as their security is usually less secure compared to larger companies.
              Cybersecurity for small companies can be very difficult to understand and implement.
               Small companies may be hesitant to fight cybercrime due to costs. However, certain security measures can be rather easy and affordable to practice.
              For example, dual factor authentication is when a user has to enter two forms of identification to gain access to something. This information could be
              something you know, something you are, or something you have. Dual factor
              authentication provides an affordable supplementary level of security.
              The principle of Least Privilege, which is giving a user only the needed necessities to do his or her job, is another example of cost-effective security.
              It is not difficult to imagine a disgruntled employee stealing valuable information. If a company is practicing Least Privilege, it will limit the amount
              of information that a disgruntled employee would be able to access
              and steal.</p>

              <p>Physical protection is another security measure that can be easily implemented and can increase a company’s cybersecurity.
              It is essential for companies to practice ways to prevent the wrong people from entering their buildings.
              Companies must provide measures to protect servers, computers, etc. Examples of ways to implement physical security are door locks, cameras, and alarm
              systems. Sony was hacked in 2014 over the controversial movie, The Interview. Hackers stated that they were able to get into Sony systems partly because the front door of the building was unlocked.
              Jason Koebler of Vice commented on the incident that, “When you leave the front door to the Louvre unlocked, don't be surprised when some pretty
              nice paintings get taken” (Koebler). Sony lost copies of unreleased movies, emails, and other valuable personal information.
              This hack may have been prevented if Sony had stronger physical security.
              Sometimes company door policies are somewhat relaxed. Employees will literally hold the door open for a stranger. While it is always good to
              have common courtesy, when your building contains valuable information, as an employee, you must never let a stranger into the building.
              In addition to the technical ways of implementing security, a company must implement physical measures to further
              strengthen its security.</p>


              <p>An affordable tool to fight cybercrime, which is used by both small and big companies, is a honeypot or honeynet. Honeypots and honeynets
                are fake networks with intentionally weak security. The idea of a honeypot is to lure in a hacker into the fake network. A hacker usually gets
                into these honeypots rather easily. The purpose of a honeypot is to discover techniques, IP addresses, and other information on an attacker.
                Certain honeypots can even show the keystrokes of a hacker. Once a company sees who is trying to get into its fake network and how they are
                doing it, they can then take action on its real network. For example, a company can patch its network to prevent bots or brute force attacks
                after seeing information of an attack from a honeypot. A firewall access control list can also be modify to block an IP address seen on a network
                 honeypot. A company has no excuse to not have a honeypot to see who is attacking its network and how a hacker may try to break into its
                 network. Most honeypots/honeynets will also notify a network of the invasion.
                Fighting cybercrime is a matter that companies can’t afford to not take seriously. Certain statistics show that over
               50% of small businesses suffer a cyber attack. 60% of small businesses that undergo an attack are out of business in six months (Koulopoulos).</p>
