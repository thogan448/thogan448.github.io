            <p>  The fact that women and other minority groups are not

            equally participating in STEM fields is frightening. It is no secret that STEM fields provide well-paying

            jobs. Programmers and IT workers are essential for the future as the world is becoming

            more automated. Also, certain careers, such as accounting and nursing maybe replaced by computers

            and machines. If women and other minority groups do not get involved in STEM

            careers in the near future, it will put these groups at a further disadvantage in society. I feel that mentorship

            is critical to getting minority groups involved in computer science. I was fortunate enough to have a friend

            who got me interested in computers at the right age and has provided me guidance throughout my career. Due to the gender/racial gap in

            computer science, female/minority in STEM may have a different experience than the stereotypical STEM worker/student.

            Companies and schools must set up mentoring opportunities for women/minority

            STEM workers so they can connect and receive guidance from other women/minority STEM

            workers.</p>



            <p>

              Exposure is also critical in getting underrepresented groups involved in STEM fields. Technology is expensive.

              However, this does not mean students at schools who can't afford certain technology should not have access to tech.

              All middle schools and high schools need to invest in technology and expose students to computer science at a young age.

              Also, we need to work on ending the stereotype that computer science is for socially awkward, white, nerdy males.

              Hollywood loves to depict programmers as the loner type despite the fact most programmers work in teams. When students are deciding what to major

              in, they are usually at an age when they care about what their peers think about them. It is unacceptable that some students maybe hesitant to major

              in CS because they don't fit the stereotype.
