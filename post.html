            <p>    <p>In March 2018, a woman from Arizona was killed by one of Uber's self-driving cars.
              Uber reacted to the March incident by suspending the trial phase of their self-driving cars. Uber now plans to monitor drivers
              to make sure they are paying attention, have two human drivers that can manually operate the self-driving car, and have the car’s automatic
              braking system active at all times (Moon). Uber and self-driving cars rightfully received a lot of criticism
              after the fatal accident back in March. However, it is important to remember that when a new technology is in its testing phase, it
              is not going to perform perfectly. Uber may have also been a little overconfident in their product while testing. In
             my opinion, Uber should have been monitoring their drivers live before the accident happened.
             Nonetheless, Uber has become more cautious about their technology and has made the necessary
             changes to start testing again.</p>

             <p> Often when I talk to people about self-driving cars they simply do not like the idea of them. I believe part of this is due to
               fact humans tend to not like change, or even the idea of change. Growing up, I remember Gen Xs always complaining how millennials were
               addicted to cells phones. While these complaints were justified, as time went on, Gen Xs realized how invaluable
                cell phones are. Almost every adult in America now owns a smartphone which has replaced their GPS, alarm clock, camera, calculator, etc.
                Autonomous cars are in their testing phase and deserve criticism when they fail. Self-driving cars will be safer than
                human drivers as technology advances and further testing is completed. When this happens, criticism against autonomous will not be justified. People against autonomous cars will often point to one outlier incident
                where a self-driving car failed. However, humans are not good drivers either. We are constantly playing with the
                radio, answering calls, and taking our eyes off the road. Even when self-driving cars are safer than human drivers, people will resist them. This resentment
                will fade once people experience, first hand, the value/worth of self-driving cars.</p>
