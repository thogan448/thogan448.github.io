            <p>In March 2018, a woman from Arizona was killed by one of Uber's self-driving cars. Uber reacted to this tragic accident by suspending the trial phase of its self-driving cars.
              Uber now plans to monitor drivers to make sure they are paying attention, have two human drivers that can manually operate the self-driving car, and have the car’s automatic braking system
              active at all times (Moon). Uber and self-driving cars rightfully received a lot of criticism after the fatal accident back in March. However, it is important to remember that when a new
              technology is in its testing phase, it is not going to perform perfectly. Uber may have also been a little overconfident in its product while testing. In my opinion, Uber should have been
              monitoring its drivers live before the accident happened. Nonetheless, Uber has become more cautious about its technology and has made the necessary changes to start testing again.</p>

             <p>Often when I talk to people about self-driving cars, they simply do not like the idea of them. I think part of this hesitancy is because humans tend to dislike change or even the idea of change.
               Growing up, I remember Gen Xs always complaining about how millennials were addicted to smartphones. While these complaints were justified, as time went on, Gen Xs realized how invaluable cell phones are for daily tasks. Almost every adult in
               America now owns a smartphone which has replaced his/her GPS, alarm clock, camera, calculator, etc. Autonomous cars are in their testing phase and deserve criticism when they fail. But, self-driving
               cars will become safer than human drivers as technology advances and further testing is completed. When this happens, criticism against autonomous cars will become less justified. People against
               autonomous cars will often emphasize one outlier incident where a self-driving car failed. However, humans are not always reliable drivers either. We are constantly playing with the radio, answering
               calls, and taking our eyes off the road. Even when self-driving cars are safer than human drivers, people will resist them because they are nervous about change. This resistance, however, will fade
               once people experience, first hand, the value and worth of self-driving cars.</p>
